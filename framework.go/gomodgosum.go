/*Go mod and Go sum are two related concepts in the Go programming language.

Go mod is the package manager for Go that was introduced in Go 1.11. It manages the dependencies of a Go project by creating a go.mod file that specifies the required dependencies and their versions. Go mod also provides a way to download and cache dependencies, so that they can be used offline. It is used to manage the module and version information for a Go project.

Go sum is a security feature that was added in Go 1.13. It verifies the checksums of the downloaded modules to ensure that they have not been tampered with. When a module is downloaded, Go mod also generates a go.sum file that contains the cryptographic hashes of the downloaded modules. This file ensures that the modules have not been modified or tampered with between the time they were uploaded to a repository and the time they were downloaded to the local system.

In summary, go.mod is used to manage the dependencies and versions of a Go project, while go.sum is used to verify the integrity of the downloaded modules. Both files are generated by Go mod, and they work together to ensure that the dependencies of a Go project are managed securely and reliably.
