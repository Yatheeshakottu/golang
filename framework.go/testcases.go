  //can golang return unit test cases?
		
		/*Yes, Go allows you to define and run unit test cases for your code. You can define unit tests in a separate file with a _test.go suffix or in the same file as your code.

To write a unit test in Go, you can use the testing package, which provides functions to define test cases and to report the results of the tests. The most commonly used function is func TestXxx(*testing.T), where Xxx is the name of the function being tested.

Here's an example of a unit test in Go:

go
Copy code
package mypackage

import "testing"

func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    result := MyFunction(2)
    if result != 4 {
        t.Errorf("MyFunction(2) = %d; want 4", result)
    }
}
In this example, the unit test is defined for the MyFunction function in the mypackage package. The TestMyFunction function takes a *testing.T parameter and performs the test. In this case, it calls the MyFunction function with an argument of 2 and checks that the result is equal to 4. If the result is not 4, the t.Errorf function is called to report an error.

You can run your unit tests using the go test command, which will automatically discover and run all of the tests in your package. The go test command will report the results of the tests and any errors or failures that occur.*/
