/*This is a Go program that starts an HTTP server and listens on port 8080. When a client makes a request to the server, the server sends a response with the message "Hello World!".

The program starts by importing the "fmt" and "http" packages, which provide functions for formatting output and handling HTTP requests and responses.

The main function sets up an HTTP handler function, which is triggered every time the server receives a request. The handler function uses the "fmt.Fprint" function to write the string "Hello World!" to the response writer.

The "http.ListenAndServe" function is then called with the port number ":8080" and a value of "nil" for the handler. This starts the HTTP server and makes it listen for incoming requests on port 8080.

If an error occurs while starting the server, the program will panic with the error message. This is a basic error handling mechanism in Go.

This program can be run by saving it to a file with a ".go" extension and running the "go run" command in a terminal. When the program is running, you can access the "Hello World!" message by opening a web browser and navigating to "http://localhost:8080".
